I promised I'd write every day, so here's a quick review of the movies I watched with my girlfriend over Christmas.

### The Gentlemen: 6/10

Charlie Hunnam is great in this, and I loved watching Hugh Grant be a slimy weasel. Pretty funny, but probably not going to live long in my memory. Highlight was the Bugzy Malone "fight porn" video and song.

### Jason Bourne: 4/10

Dogshit. Jason Bourne was barely in it, and it committed every conceivable computer spying/hacking sin: "enhance", "they're through the firewall", "malware planted", etc. Alicia Vikander seems wasted and bored.

### Midnight in Paris: 7/10

Charming, funny, Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) is great. Strong message about not living in the past. Rachel McAdams and Michael Sheen are incredible at being obnoxious.

### Kiss Kiss Bang Bang: 8/10

I love Val Kilmer, and I think Gay Perry is one of his best, next to Doc Holliday. Didn't love the RDJ voice over, but the rest of the dialogue is excellent. Standout line: "I shot him with a small revolver I keep near my balls." I still think I prefer the Nice Guys, but I'll have to rewatch to confirm.

### Ocean's 13: 5/10

Incredibly stupid, switches between characters every 10 seconds, no one gets any real screen time. Still pretty fun.
